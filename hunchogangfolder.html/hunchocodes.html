<p> My passion is...photography</p>

<p>Since i was in middle school ive been obessed with cameras jus taking pictures of random things 
plus i love the idea of nature something about nature and a camera is paradise in one for me nature is really beautiful to me someone has to capture every moment of it 
an? A photography club and My older brother,My older brother is a photographer himself he actually taught me
    how to take a picture with bad lighting and how to edit and up load it to a laptop</p>

<p>My brother he actually took half of his wife's bridal shower picture 
and it came out beautiful which made me want to try harder in the field. having a camera in my hand is
like self therapy for me its like im in my own zone its like heaven on earth its me and a camera against the whole world</p>

<p>Til this day my brother keeps me inspired and i love that simply because he never stop doing photography even if he works or streams
he still findsa way to get some photos in and also nature inspires me too,because its so calm and what
keeps the world together</p>
