<p> My passion is...photography</p>
<p>Since i was in middle school ive been obessed with cameras jus taking pictures of random things 
plus i love the idea of nature something about nature and a camera is paradise in one for me nature is really beautiful to me someone has to capture every moment of it 
<p>an? A photography club and My older brother,My older brother is a photographer himself he actually taught me
    how to take a picture with bad lighting and how to edit and up load it to a laptop</p>

<p>My brother he actually took half of his wife's bridal shower picture 
and it came out beautiful which made me want to try harder in the field. having a camera in my hand is
like self therapy for me its like im in my own zone its like heaven on earth its me and a camera against the whole world
